//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name.

// QUESTION NO 43
// Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array.

// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich.
